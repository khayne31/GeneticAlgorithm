# GeneticAlgorithm

A program which takes a target string and attempts to use a Genetic Algorithm to take a random string of numbers and evolve it into the target string.

For example give the program a target string of "Hello World" and it will generate a random string of letter which through the evolution process will eventually say "Hello World"
